# GoDexArbitrage

## Description
This project is an arbitrage bot for decentralized exchanges (DEX) written in Go. Its aim is to identify and exploit price differences across various DEXs to achieve profit. This bot will automate the process of executing arbitrage transactions, taking into account factors like transaction fees, price slippage, and execution time.

## Planned Features
- **Arbitrage Opportunity Detection**: Identify real-time price differences across multiple DEXs.
- **Automated Execution**: Perform transactions automatically when arbitrage opportunities are identified.
- **Risk Management**: Limit exposure to risks by setting profitability and loss thresholds.
- **Reporting and Analytics**: Generate detailed reports on the bot's performance.
- **User Interface**: Provide an interface for monitoring and configuring the bot.

## Technologies Used
- **Go**: Primary programming language for developing the bot.
- **DEX APIs**: To fetch market data and execute transactions.
- **Docker/Kubernetes**: For deployment and scalability.

## Installation and Usage (To Be Developed)
This section will be updated with details on how to install and use the bot once development has progressed.
